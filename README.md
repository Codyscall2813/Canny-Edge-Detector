# Canny-Edge-Detector
Edge and contour detection are fundamental techniques in computer vision and image processing. These methods help identify object boundaries, shapes, and significant features within images. This implementation provides a complete pipeline for detecting edges using the Canny edge detector and finding contours in images using OpenCV.
